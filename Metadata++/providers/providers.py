Metadata providers — v6.2.14
New in v6.2.14 (Jadehawk Edits):
  - _page_is_audiobook(): removed the "soft signal" block (audible.com +
    acx.com links, 2+ required).  Amazon includes BOTH of these as footer
    links on EVERY product page, so they were never reliable product-type
    indicators and caused false positives on normal Kindle/print pages
    (confirmed with ASIN B0F344HDYN "Target Practice").  The three
    structural JSON signals (productGroup, binding, Listening Length) are
    sufficient.
  - _amazon_fetch(): added a one-time log.warning when urllib returns a
    bot-block page and the browser fallback is not active, telling the user
    to enable "Use Firefox browser as fallback" in plugin Options.  The
    warning fires at most once per Calibre session (module-level
    _browser_block_hint_logged flag) so it is not spammy.
  - browser_fetch.py: fixed Windows-incompatible && in the "install
    playwright" warning message; replaced with two numbered install steps.
  - fetch_engine.py _run_browser_pass(): upgraded silent log.info "browser
    pass skipped" to log.warning with step-by-step setup instructions so
    the user knows exactly how to enable the browser fallback.
  - config.py: added _InstallerThread (QThread) + _PlaywrightSetupDialog
    (QDialog) — a live-output wizard that runs "pip install playwright" then
    "playwright install firefox" with streaming progress and a final
    pass/fail banner.  _check_playwright() now opens this dialog instead of
    showing a static text panel.

Metadata providers — v6.2.13
New in v6.2.13:
  - _get(): Google 403s are now diagnosed instead of treated as a generic
    blocked response. Unlike the keyless 429 (shared anonymous per-minute
    quota), a 403 almost always means the configured API key itself has a
    problem — Books API not enabled for it, wrong project, a referer/IP
    restriction, or the key's *daily* (not per-minute) quota is exhausted —
    or, if no key is set, that the anonymous daily quota is exhausted. The
    response body's error message is now extracted and logged so the real
    cause is visible instead of a bare "HTTP 403".
  - All sources active by default per explicit user request — see
    fetch_engine.py v6.2.13. Reminder: this changes whether the plugin asks
    kobo.com/lafeltrinelli.it/fnac.es/libraccio.it/opac.sbn.it/
    catalogo.bne.es, not whether those sites respond — they were disabled
    specifically because field logs show them 403/404-ing every request.

Metadata providers — v6.2.12
New in v6.2.12:
  - _get(): fixed a real bug — HTTP 500/502/504 (transient server errors,
    e.g. the Internet Archive 502 seen in field logs) were never retried,
    unlike 429/503 which already had a backoff-and-retry path. A single
    502 on attempt 1 now correctly retries up to `retries` times with the
    same exponential backoff used for 429/503, instead of giving up
    immediately.
  - fetch_google: optional Google Books API key support (Options tab →
    "Google Books API Key"). Field logs show 429 firing on literally the
    very first Google call of a brand-new run — that pattern means the
    *anonymous* per-IP quota (shared across everyone hitting Google Books
    without a key from that IP/network) was already exhausted before this
    plugin even made a request, which no amount of in-plugin backoff can
    fix. A free key from Google Cloud Console gets a much higher quota and
    is appended to every request when set; left blank, behaviour is
    unchanged.
  - fetch_goodreads: search misses are now logged at INFO instead of DEBUG,
    so "goodreads=empty" in the per-source outcome line is no longer
    indistinguishable from a silent failure — you can now see in the log
    whether Goodreads genuinely has no listing for a title (common for
    very obscure self-published books) vs. something else going wrong.
    Link-matching regex also widened to handle single-quoted and absolute
    -URL hrefs in the search results page.

Metadata providers — v6.2.11
New in v6.2.11:
  - NEW fetch_goodreads: Goodreads (goodreads.com) HTML scrape — registered
    as a global, on-by-default source with a high weight specifically
    because its synopses are usually long, clean, and untruncated, so they
    tend to win the best-synopsis scoring in fetch_engine._merge_results
    (see that file's v6.2.11 changelog entry). Also supplies rating and
    genre tags.
  - fetch_worldcat now returns immediately without making any network call,
    regardless of the use_worldcat toggle's stored value. xisbn.worldcat.org
    has been dead since 2016, but a stale persisted True from an old config
    (use_worldcat was missing from the v6.2.9 stale-prefs migration) was
    still triggering a real connection attempt on every run, surfacing as a
    raw socket reset ("[WinError 10054] ... interrotta ... dall'host
    remoto") in field logs instead of a clean HTTP failure. Fixed at both
    layers: config.py's migration now also clears use_worldcat, and this
    function no longer makes the dead call even if some other on-disk
    config still has it set to True.

Metadata providers — v6.2.10
New in v6.2.10:
  - fetch_amazon: added _amazon_page_is_blocked(), a broader bot-challenge
    page detector. The previous code only checked for one CAPTCHA-page
    string ("Enter the characters"), so several other Amazon interstitial
    pages (the "Sorry, we just need to make sure you're not a robot" page,
    the automated-access warning page, etc.) were being treated as real
    HTML — fed straight to the title parser, which correctly found no real
    product title in them and returned nothing, with zero indication of
    *why*. Every dead end in fetch_amazon now logs whether the page was a
    confirmed bot-block or a real page the parser genuinely failed on.
  - fetch_amazon: added realistic Sec-Fetch-*/Sec-Ch-Ua/Cache-Control
    headers (matching what an actual Chrome navigation sends) and a small
    randomized pre-search delay. Field logs showed the /s? search endpoint
    503-ing on the very first attempt for nearly every book, which looks
    like edge-WAF fingerprinting of non-browser-shaped requests rather
    than pure per-request rate limiting.
  - _parse_amazon_page now accepts an optional `log` param so the
    audiobook-page bailout is visible in diagnostics instead of silent.

Metadata providers — v6.2.7
New in v6.2.7:
  - fetch_kobo (dead stub) replaced with real regional Kobo store providers:
    fetch_kobo_com, fetch_kobo_es, fetch_kobo_it, fetch_kobo_fr, fetch_kobo_de.
    Each provider targets the matching Kobo storefront via the public search
    endpoint (store.kobobooks.com/<locale>/Search?Query=…) and parses JSON-LD /
    og: tags from the product page.  The old monolithic 'kobo' source is gone;
    regional sources auto-activate exactly like Feltrinelli/BNE/BNF do.
  - fetch_bne: primary endpoint changed from datos.bne.es/api/obras.json
    (returns 404 as of 2024) to the BNE SRU catalogue endpoint
    (bne.es/es/Catalogos/BibliografiaEspanola/…); HTML fallback also updated
    to use the modern catalogue.bne.es search URL format.
  - fetch_fnac_es: added Sec-Fetch-* and cache-control headers that reduce
    the 403 rate on fnac.es; added a plain-text fallback search URL pattern
    that works even when the full search page is blocked.

New in v6.2.6 (bugfix):
  - fetch_amazon ISBN dp/ lookup: added local-TLD fallback (e.g. amazon.it
    for Italian ISBNs) mirroring the existing ASIN dp/ fallback — regional
    ISBNs that redirect on amazon.com now resolve correctly.

New in v6.2.5:
  - fetch_amazon search fallback: strip "(Spanish Edition)" / "(Edición…)"
    and subtitle noise from the query before searching — prevents Amazon
    from surfacing a print-edition ISBN-10 in data-asin instead of the
    Kindle ASIN.
  - fetch_amazon search fallback: try up to 5 data-asin candidates instead
    of only the first; real ASINs (contain a letter) are tried before
    pure-digit ISBN-10 values; each candidate is only kept if _parse_amazon_page
    returns a non-empty title.
  - fetch_amazon search fallback: log "trying next" when a dp/ page yields
    no title so the behaviour is visible in the run log.

New in v6.2.4:
  - _parse_amazon_page: added _AMAZON_JUNK_TITLES blocklist so og:title
    values like "Amazon.es" (returned by bot-challenged or redirect pages)
    are rejected rather than stored as the book title.
  - _parse_amazon_page: centralised _clean_amazon_title() helper validates
    every title candidate before accepting it — applied to all 6 extraction
    patterns so a junk value in any slot can't slip through.
  - _parse_amazon_page: added data-feature-name="title" / id="dp-title"
    patterns (newer SPA layout used on .es/.it) as pattern 2.
  - _parse_amazon_page: og:title now also matched when content= attribute
    appears before property= (attribute order varies across storefronts).
  - _parse_amazon_page: JSON-LD pattern uses .{0,3000}? (allows any char
    including '}') instead of [^}]{0,2000} which broke on nested objects.

New in v6.2.3:
  - _parse_amazon_page: added 4 additional title extraction patterns (JSON-LD
    "name", og:title, React/Apollo JSON, <title> tag) so regional storefronts
    like amazon.es that don't always render id="productTitle" now return a
    title rather than an identifiers-only dict that gets discarded by merge.
  - _parse_amazon_page: now returns {} (not an identifiers-only dict) when no
    title can be extracted — prevents "Merge produced only identifiers" warning.
  - _parse_amazon_page: added JSON-LD and og:author fallbacks for author
    extraction on regional storefronts.
  - fetch_amazon: sets locale-appropriate Accept-Language header (e.g.
    es-ES for amazon.es) so regional storefronts serve their native HTML
    layout where productTitle and author spans are reliably present.

New in v6.2:
  - fetch_amazon: now routes to language-appropriate Amazon storefront
    (amazon.es for Spanish, amazon.it for Italian, amazon.fr for French,
    amazon.de for German, amazon.co.jp for Japanese, amazon.com.br for
    Portuguese-BR) rather than always hitting amazon.com. This is the main
    fix for 503 errors on non-English books — amazon.com actively bot-blocks
    searches for titles in languages it doesn't primarily serve.
  - fetch_amazon: per-book cooldown reset means a 503 on one book no longer
    suppresses the search fallback for ALL subsequent books in the run.
  - fetch_google: Google Books 429 cooldown is now per-book (not session-wide)
    so a rate-limit hit on book N doesn't poison every later book. Backoff
    is shorter and smarter: 2 s initial, max 8 s, never retried after 429.
  - NEW fetch_casadellibro: Casa del Libro (casadellibro.com) — major Spanish
    bookstore with rich metadata for Spanish-language titles.
  - NEW fetch_fnac_es: FNAC Spain (fnac.es) — good Spanish coverage.
  - NEW fetch_feltrinelli: Feltrinelli (lafeltrinelli.it) — largest Italian
    bookstore chain, rich metadata for Italian titles.
  - NEW fetch_libraccio: Libraccio (libraccio.it) — Italian second-hand /
    general books with good coverage.
  - NEW fetch_bnf: Bibliothèque nationale de France (data.bnf.fr) — open
    SPARQL / JSON-LD API, good for French books.
  - NEW fetch_bne: Biblioteca Nacional de España (bne.es) SRU endpoint —
    excellent for Spanish-language books including Latin American editions.
  - NEW fetch_sbn: Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale (sbn.it) SRU endpoint
    — Italian national library catalogue; best authority for Italian ISBNs.
  - All new providers accept the same (title, author, isbn, asin, lang,
    timeout, retries, log) signature as all existing providers.

Bugfixes carried forward from v6.1:
  - fetch_amazon: `lang` kwarg accepted (was missing → TypeError on every call)
  - fetch_google: langRestrict removed; best-scored candidate selected
  - fetch_openlibrary: work-level description fetched for title/author path
  - All providers: no language restriction anywhere

    even though the same URL serves a GET just fine — a known anti-

    a lower-resolution Google Books cover that happens to answer HEAD
    cleanly — exactly the "wrong/lower-quality cover gets applied" bug
    reported by users whose book already had the correct high-res Amazon

    Fix: try HEAD first (cheap, no body download). If it fails or returns
    no usable Content-Length, fall back to a ranged GET (Range: bytes=0-0)
    — most CDNs that block HEAD still honour ranged GETs — and read the

    Return True when a cover image is effectively blank / a placeholder —
    a near-uniform flat colour (or two-tone) canvas rather than genuine
    cover artwork.

    WHY THIS EXISTS: has_white_border_padding() only inspects a thin strip
    along each of the 4 edges, so it correctly catches a real illustration
    centred on a white/near-white background. It does NOT catch:
      - A cover CDN response that is blank/placeholder across its ENTIRE
        canvas (e.g. a broken Google Books thumbnail, a generic "no cover
        available" tile, or a solid-colour stock image) — there's no
        illustrated centre for the border check to contrast against.
      - Placeholder colours other than white (light grey "unavailable"
        tiles, flat brand-colour filler images, etc.).
    These images can still have a large raw pixel canvas (satisfying
    cover_quality()'s pixel-count comparison) while conveying zero real
    information about what the book actually looks like — exactly the
    "truthfulness" problem: a bigger blank image is not a better cover.

    Detection: downsample to a small 32x32 thumbnail (fast, robust to
    JPEG noise) and check both:
      1. Overall pixel value standard deviation — real cover art has
         strong contrast/detail even at 32x32; flat or near-flat images
         don't.
      2. Number of visually distinct colours (coarse-bucketed to 4 bits
         per channel) — a handful of buckets means large flat regions.
    Either signal alone flags the image as blank/placeholder.

    Requires Pillow + numpy (bundled with Calibre). Returns False safely
    on any error, and treats undecodable/too-tiny images as blank too
    (they can't be a trustworthy cover either).

    Like cover_quality(), but padding-aware.

    ROOT CAUSE OF THE "good cover replaced by a padded thumbnail" BUG:
    cover_quality() intentionally does NOT penalise white-border padding
    (see its docstring) — that filtering was only ever applied *between*
    fetched candidates, inside dialogs.py's _fetch_best_cover(). But when
    every fetched candidate for a book turns out to be padded (e.g. only a
    letterboxed Google Books/Amazon editorial thumbnail is available),
    _fetch_best_cover() falls back to returning that padded image anyway
    (a padded cover beats no cover). The *final* decision of whether to
    overwrite the book's existing cover then compared raw cover_quality()
    tuples — and a padded canvas's blank margins inflate its width*height
    enough to numerically outscore a smaller but full-bleed, higher-quality
    existing cover, even though the padded image is visually worse.

    Fix: when has_white_border_padding() flags an image, measure the
    pixel count of just the non-white content region (crop out the
    margins) instead of the full padded canvas. A clean full-bleed cover
    is unaffected (its content region ~= its full canvas), while a

# /book/show/<id> URL, then the book page itself supplies title, author,
# rating, genres, cover and — most importantly — a full, untruncated
# synopsis. Goodreads descriptions are typically longer and cleaner than the
# og:description meta tag (which Goodreads truncates with a trailing
# "...more" link), so we pull the full text out of the page's embedded JSON
# payload first and only fall back to Open Graph tags if that's missing.
# Registered as a high-weight global source (see fetch_engine.SOURCE_REGISTRY)
# so its synopsis tends to win the best-synopsis scoring in _merge_results.

    request returned a page with no extractable result link.

    # ROOT CAUSE of "Spanish edition picked for an Italian book search on
    # amazon.it": _parse_amazon_page never extracted a language at all, so
    # fetch_amazon's search-candidate loop had no way to tell a Spanish
    # Kindle edition apart from an Italian one — it just accepted whichever
    # of the first few data-asin candidates parsed a title. Amazon storefronts
    # sell books in every language regardless of TLD (amazon.it stocks
    # Spanish, English, etc. editions too), so the TLD alone is not a
    # reliable language signal.
    #
    # Two signals are checked, cheapest/most reliable first:
    #   1. The edition marker still present in the *raw* (uncleaned) title
    #      fragment, e.g. "(Spanish Edition)" / "(Edición española)" /
    #      "(edizione italiana)" — _clean_amazon_title() strips this before
    #      we ever see it above, so we re-derive it from _title_raw's source
    #      fragment captured before cleaning would have removed it. Since we
    #      don't keep that pre-clean string around, we re-search the raw
    #      page HTML directly for the same marker patterns instead.
    #   2. The "Language" / "Idioma" / "Lingua" / "Langue" / "Sprache" row in
    #      Amazon's product-details panel, which is present on most product
    #      pages regardless of storefront language.
